<div class="slide black phone"><div class="sheet">
  <p>A lone ﬁgure sits at a desk in an oﬃce. The oﬃce has soaring windows, and imposingly high ceilings, but the man is tall and his mannerisms are broad—the expansiveness of his oﬃce feels appropriate. His artfully unkempt hair hangs down to his shoulders, and his black oﬃce chair seems too plain for his long, dynamic limbs. If I had to characterize his oﬃce with a sound, it would be a quietly thudding rhythm: <i>lub-dub</i> pause, <i>lub-dub</i> pause, <i>lub-dub</i> pause, and so on. For the man is Brian Robinson, and when he’s at work, he’s the beating heart of the Symphony.</p>

  <p>His job? “It’s actually all the things that isn’t waving your hands in front of the orchestra,” he says with a sheepish grin. It’s an aﬀectionate snarkiness, to be expected from the longstanding Managing Director of the Yale Symphony Orchestra. Robinson’s held this post for nearly two decades, like a ﬁrmly planted rock in a shifting stream of interim conductors, imported directors, and incoming students. Normally, “There would be an operations manager, a personnel manager, a development director, a marketing manager, tour coordinator.” Instead, “It’s just all, you know, it’s all here—all centralized in one delightful package,” he says, gesturing towards himself with a large, ﬂapping hand motion.</p>

  <p>We’re meeting earlier than expected, because Brian had emailed, “Hi, Vicky. I’m gonna be leaving around 1030 to send a contrabassoon in for repair. Could we meet around 10?” I picture him swaddling an oversized contrabassoon like a small, injured bird, and reply, “No problem, see you then.” We’ve met like this a half-dozen times since he took me on as his graphic designer, so I’ve seen him in action: overseeing ticketing software for the largest performance venue on campus, arranging orchestral scores for the infamously avant-garde Halloween Show, ﬁelding questions from overzealous ﬁrst-years (“No, I really don’t think you should re-audition with a new piece—the Elgar is in your ﬁngertips”).</p>
  
  <p>When he speaks, Robinson’s distinctive, baritone voice reverberates against the stoicism of the surrounding architecture. Within these walls, he packages himself and conforms to expectations—the daily ritual of any artist with a steady job, and the especially necessary ritual of an artist with three kids. “I spend a lot of brain energy holding myself back in every situation, except when I’m on stage.”</p>
  
  <p>On his stage, Brian Robinson transforms. Gone is the nine-to-ﬁve symphony manager, the Mannes-College-of-Music-trained composer, the comic-book-collecting dad. He’s replaced with a hot-blooded, head-banging rock n’ roll performer, long hair thrashing, long limbs ﬁnally loosened. He leaves his tightly wound, day-to-day personas somewhere backstage, and grips the microphone stand with the desperation of a man drowning.</p>

  <p>But Robinson’s music is a far cry from classic rock. To be precise, it’s exactly as far from classic rock as it is from classical orchestral music. Robinson is the founder, lead singer, and composer for The Tet Oﬀensive, a string quartet rock band that’s been performing in New Haven and New York since 2009.  “Yeah, it’s a band, ‘cause it’s got a drummer,” he admits when I press him for clearer terminology. “The only diﬀerence is that the guitar and the bass are being played by strings—other string instruments.” Calling it a band ﬁrst, string ensemble second, makes sense given his Guilford, Connecticut roots. “I grew up in the suburbs, where classic rock was the only genre they let you listen to,” he explains, leaving us guessing as to who “they” are, and whether Big Brother preferred the gritty melodies of Lynyrd Skynyrd over the searing guitar solos of Pink Floyd. Robinson had some classical exposure in chorus and theatre, but “Even then it was a lot of Disney arrangements.”</p>

  <p>There’s a moment in every good story where everything slows and the music gets louder— something important is about to happen. Brian Robinson’s moment occurred when he ﬁrst heard the Bartok string quartet playing on the radio.</p>

  <p>“I was seventeen so everything was super passionate . . . I had to pull over and stop the car and listen to the string quartet, because it was the most incredible thing I’d ever heard.” He recognized Bartok’s essence—seething, expressive, and undeniably human—because he hadn’t been conditioned otherwise. The demure sophistication of classical music culture (a culture of rustling gowns, dimmed lights, and uncomfortable chairs) warps our perception of the genre’s sound. So while we hear an overarching balance and inhuman precision, Robinson hears the musician’s underlying, unbridled energy.</p>

  <p>“Which is the same thing I like about rock music—not just the loudness, but . . . the intensity. I like when somebody lets their whole soul out into the music. It’s not restrained at all. It’s actually very passionate, even though it’s calculated.” The hybridized arrangements and original compositions that Robinson writes for The Tet Oﬀensive chip away at this façade of control and restraint, revealing the passionate and soulful physicality of the string instrument itself.</p>

  <p>“You’ve got horse hair grating against gut string, it’s so organic. And the vibrations from those instruments, ampliﬁed by their own wood. It’s so visceral. That’s the word. It’s visceral. I wanted to get that across. I think that if we educate the general public more about how visceral classical music is, that it won’t be taken for granted as much, and that people will dig deeper and discover more of that music. Not default to whatever the louder scores are telling us to listen to.”</p>

  <p>When he’s speaking this way, Robinson’s thoughts seem to gain momentum, and his tone of voice becomes even, and quiet, and prophetic. Even though he’s talking classical, he exudes the deﬁance of a rock star. Defending his genre requires this kind of rebelliousness, because most people expect a “string quartet rock band” to take the melodies of beloved rock songs and smooth them into neat, orchestral arrangements. The Tet Oﬀensive intentionally delivers the very opposite.</p>

  <p>“We’re not pretty. You get us on the stage and you see that I’m literally ﬂailing on the stage in costume, and the strings are ripping and shredding and drums are banging. I want to catch everyone by surprise.” Live, his music might come across as chaotic, perhaps even blasphemous to a purist of either genre. But Robinson’s compositions are grounded in a knowledgeable appreciation of both rock and classical.</p>

  <p>“String instruments have a versatility that the guitar and the bass don’t. And they don’t rely on ampliﬁcation or eﬀects—they have to rely on counterpoint and harmonies.” By tapping into the essential qualities of each genre, he creates a sound that infuses the technical sophistication of classical with something “more raw and accessible.”</p>

  <p>“Accessible sometimes gets translated into ‘pretty’ or ‘easy to listen to’ . . . I feel like accessible means that it’s relevant to people today. Haydn’s great, but that’s 400-year-old music. It touches emotional cores of things that are universal, but it doesn’t reach today. I listen to early-20th and mid-20th century music and I hear the struggle and the anxiety and the worry and the fear and the speed at which things are going, and I go, ‘Wow that touches me, that I understand.’”</p>

  <p>As he launches into a tangent on Phillip Glass, a proliﬁc minimalist composer of the late-20th century, I’m reminded of my supplementary interview with Daisy, a Yale administrator with an MFA in Creative Writing. She’s seen Brian Robinson on his stage, so she remembers his stage presence, his musicality, his hair. But then more quietly, she adds, “I think he wishes he could do more.”   Asking an artist whether he’d like to quit his day job and try to “make it big” comes across naïve at best, and outright mean-spirited at worst. So instead, I listen to Robinson talk about Glass, hoping to catch him sounding wistful.</p>

  <p>“I think people get Phillip Glass totally wrong. They think he’s repetitive and droning, and I’m like, ‘No, no. There’s something really incredible happening that he’s touching on.’ He was a New York City cab driver before he became famous—he completely understands the bohemian lifestyle, the experience of living poor in a fast city. That’s what he’s doing with music. I hear it every time I listen to it. This is somebody who’s translating that bustle that he sees around him— but he’s not a part of it.”</p>

  <p>Per usual, Brian Robinson seems completely smitten with the act of translation—taking the experience of living a double life, and turning it into sound.</p></div></div>

      <div class="slide black phone"><div class="sheet">

      			<p>Somewhere between humans discovering fire and humans discovering 3D modeling software, our technological limitations gave rise to charmingly limited video games like Mario, a simple universe where the screen never stops scrolling and you never stop running. The momentum never feels imposing, because the rapture of hophop-hopping on over the next obstacle makes Mario’s direction (forward) feel more like a religion than a rule of the game. Toro y Moi’s most recent album, <i>Outer Peace</i>, feels as exuberant and lonely as you’d imagine Mario feels on his frenetic, perpetual quest, albeit with more existential musings (To hop, or not to hop?). Even the album’s overarching sonic style evokes a kind of playful, digitized nostalgia, propelled forward by much funkier and more sensuous undertones. Each song enters purposefully, making no effort to blend in with the last; you’ve beaten another level of the game and fading into the next would ruin the fun.</p> <p>Rest assured, <i>Outer Peace</i> still flows like a smooth n’ rounded, chilled can of lime La Croix, Generation iPhone-XYZ-ready production. Moi is known as one of the founding fathers of the chillwave movement, which took the early 2010s SoundCloud scene by storm with its hypnotically dreamy sound, beach-worshipping lyrics, and neon-but-somehow-still-soft color palette. The term “chillwave” was originally a snub, coined by a satirical blog to describe their homogenous and synth-smoothed music, but the artists shrugged it on and over their shoulders like a proud, meaningless shroud. Unsurprisingly, their easy-to-produce and even easier-to-consume sound lost its traction, taking on a twinge of escapism as its soft sunsets bled into oversaturated markets.</p><p> Toro y Moi jumped ship, opting for sound experiments that are too unselfconscious to be chillwave — less, “I want you to feel me” and more, “I’m feeling it, hbu?” Instead of swaddling replaceable lyrics in pleasurable beats, Moi shows philosophical care for the world, citing Prometheus as sarcastic proof that, “you are your own boss.” He repeatedly refers to life as a game, which would feel nihilistic if he didn’t follow “Level up, you've got to make a bonus” with, “People tend to listen when they see your soul.” He continues to pull from the nostalgic 1980s soundscape of chillwave, but infuses it with a contemplative poeticism, giving us the sense that he grew up in the same post-9/11, economically insecure, career-as-identity crisis era we were born into. The achingly lonely piano in “New House” feels like an anthem for the resigned and the listless, its tolling rhythm and tinny, aging sound conveying a sense of vulnerable defiance. It’s the kind of music you’d sink into if you didn’t have the rest of Moi’s album to dance to.</p><p> But when it comes to featuring other artists, like Wet on the track “Monte Carlo,” the sound becomes too self-aware, tugging awkwardly on its own downbeats, like the bearer of an ill-fitting dress shirt on a middle school dancefloor. “Miss Me” featuring ABRA floats in promisingly at the midway point of the album, but the lyrics are weighed down by their own romance and yearning (“me,” “you,” and a very drawn out “baby”). ABRA’s tonal quality is breathy, grasping at the idea of sensuality with the unconvincing performativity of Valentine’s Day—sure, you get the idea behind it, you just don’t buy it. The ballad’s singing is at odds with Toro’s vocal method throughout the rest of the album, which prioritizes digital sounds over human ones. He features beats prominently, evoking the undeniability of rock guitar solos and the uninhibited cleverness of jazz. He wields them all with a kind of cheeky expertise, accentuating words in droplets of sound or even letting them take over for the lyrics at times, like when “I don’t give a f—“s into a melodic twirl that dances around you for another few seconds before closing out the song.</p><p> <i>Outer Peace</i> is so consistently dance-able that the album seems to taunt you with its lyrics, which paint a world that doesn’t feel worth dancing for. As if it’s saying that surviving is about turning inwards, cutting connections, saving face, but living has always been about beating down your ridiculous monsters and hopping on past them. Making your own rules, and following Mario’s religion: forward.</p></div></div>
